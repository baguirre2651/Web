						<p> [Upon reading this article, some stuff I learned a lot about Dark Patterns and its use in UX/UI design. There are many  elements that trick users into taking actions they don't really want to take and these patterns are created to benefit companies by accumulating more sales and subscriptions, but can have a negative impact on the user experience.
							Designers should be responsible for creating transparent user interfaces and avoid using Dark Patterns to manipulate users. 
							The article also provides a detailed description of different types of Dark Patterns and their impact on users.
							They are user interface design choices that are intentionally deceptive and manipulative. ] </p>
