							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> [Something I learned is the way that we percieve visual patterns and designs without even thinking about it. The article talks a lot about perception, interface and its corelation with the asepct of design that I really enjoyed. Breaking the way we perceive visual elements through Gestalt's principles was somethibng that I never heard of before, Emergene, Reification, Multi-Stability, Invariance. Are all elements that make the difference between a good design and an effective design interace. Overall the article brings a lot of cool focal points about what makes a good UI design, patterns and shapes, symmetry and tools are all elements that provide symmetry and heiarchy that is crucial for making an interface work.   ] </p>
