							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> [I thought this article was really insightful about the different aspects in UX that most people don't really think about. At the back of the mind, understanding psychology and behavior of the consumer is what helps make design choices in a postiive way.
								I found it very interesting in understanding what people will look at, what people pay attention to and how to keep people entertained, it was very interseting and insightful.
								I love the strategies they used and different examples as to what drives people to interact with your designs and how people will react and overall what works. 
								This article did influence me in a good way and gave me a lot of intereting tips that I will try to use in my next design projects! ] </p>
