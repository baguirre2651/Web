                    Something I learned from this article was the principles of design.
                    I never really saw aspects of design the way this article describes it and I thought it was very interesting the way it broke it down and used their own designs and visualizations to help demonstrate how effective these tatics can be.
                    Breaking it down into a "heiarchy" from hearichy > content > intent > audience, it really helps put into perspective a form of structure designers need to think in order to develop their ideas.
                    Looking for problems and finding solutions to solve these problems was something that was highlighted a lot in this article, putting heavy emphasis on the "intent" of the design process, it looks to see what problems you have and what specifically you are trying to solve.
                    <p><strong>
                    My favorite part about this article also highlighted and use real companies and examples of these companies to effectively demonstrate how useful and the thought behind each design that a comapny makes to get you hooked on their app. 
                    My favorite quote from this article was "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." Meaning that by looking at other ideas and what works for other companies, it can sometimes help build upon ur own principles and help develop your ideas into creating/designing something really unique.

                    I would give this article a solid 7/10, it does lack a bit of detail and depth I would say however, I learned a lot and think this was a useful thing to read in terms of thinking about the thinking process of a designer.
