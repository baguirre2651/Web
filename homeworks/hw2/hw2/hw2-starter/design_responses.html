							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned about this article was how it talks a lot about the importance of white space, this article discusses its role in improving the user experience by mitigating wasted space.
								The author also explains that padding/white space, when used a certain way, can actually help bring visual clarity and bring a sense of balance to a web page.
								Furthermore, they used lots of examples from Wayfair products to effectively show how white space helps maintain focus, improves visual organization, and increases readability.
								I also learned that not all white space is wasted space and that this is actaully a myth, people will still scroll to see the content's page. The rule of 8 was also a good rule and practice towards keeping track of consistency across a website. 
								Overall white space when used effectively can actaully be a powerful too and a useful resource when intergrating the aspects of design into your website or product as well. </p>
